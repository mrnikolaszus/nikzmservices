# Personal Project Notes

## Disclaimer

This project is not intended to provide any significant value to external users. It serves as a personal notebook for exploration and testing purposes.

## Purpose

The primary focus of this project is to facilitate my personal learning journey. Here, I delve into various technologies and concepts, specifically:

- **Spring Boot**: An application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.
- **Spring Cloud**: Tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems.
- **Docker**: A set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
- **Microservices**: A style of architecture that structures an application as a collection of services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable, and organized around business capabilities.
- **Producers and Consumers**: A design pattern where producers create data and consumers use it.
- **Service Discovery**: Automated detection of devices and services offered by these devices on a computer network.
- **Eureka Server**: REST based service for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.
- **Load Balancers & Load Balancer Algorithms**: A device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers, using various algorithms to do so efficiently.
- **RabbitMQ**: An open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.
- **Kafka**: An open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

## Objective

The goal is to use this project as a sandbox for learning and experimenting with the aforementioned technologies and architectural patterns. It's a space where I can test out ideas, break things without consequence, and gradually build my understanding of these complex topics.
